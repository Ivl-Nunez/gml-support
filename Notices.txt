The following functions are temporarily not added:

New in GameMaker 8.1:

draw_self() This command is exactly the same as draw_sprite_ext() except it will use the instances own variables to draw itself (x,y, scale, angle etc.) This provides the same action as if the instance was draw without a script.

在游戏绘制——高级绘制函数中的函数（这些函数将在后续版本中添加）：

sprite_get_texture(spr,subimg) 返回纹理id对应于精灵子图。
background_get_texture(back) 返回纹理id对应于背景。
